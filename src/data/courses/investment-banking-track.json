Calculate multiples for comparable set\n2. Determine appropriate range (usually 25th-75th percentile)\n3. Apply to subject company's metrics\n4. Calculate implied valuation range\n5. Sensitise for different assumptions\n\n### Example Calculation\n- Comparable companies trade at 10x-12x EBITDA\n- Your company's EBITDA: £100m\n- Implied EV range: £1,000m - £1,200m\n- Less: Net Debt of £200m\n- Implied Equity Value: £800m - £1,000m\n\n## Control Premiums\n\n**Trading Multiples**: Based on minority stakes\n**Transaction Multiples**: Include control premium (typically 20-40%)\n\nThis is why precedent transactions usually show higher multiples!",
